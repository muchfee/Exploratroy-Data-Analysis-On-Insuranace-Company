# Conclusion

The analysis carried out concludes that the tendency for disinterest in vehicle insurance is higher. This trend is not affected by whether they have previous insurance or not.

Insurance awareness level in India tends to be low, based on the referrals we use.

# Recommendation

- Offer the insurance to the customer who have a driving license
- Offer the insurance through channel 152
- Offer to the customer who previously insured their car
- Offer to the customer who have been involved in an accident
- Offer to the customer who just recently buy a car
